Time Complexity = time it takes to complete the computations of an algorithm

O(n): Linear
O(logn): Binary search
O(n^2): For loop within a for loop

As number of elements(n) increases, O(logn) is the best, then O(n), O(n^2) is not recommended.

O(1): constant time, time complexity does not grow with the size of n
O(n)
O(logn): logarithmic search, marginal increases in time for new inputs
O(n^2): the square of n for the amount of time



Practice questions:
1. time complexity: O(n) because the for loop iterates through a portion of the array that scales with the input size 'n'.
