Space Complexity = input space(memory for data) + auxiliary space(extra memory)

Space Complexity: The amount of memory an algorithm uses. It's like the **storage space**. 

Creating a new array leads to the use of more memory thus it would lead to a higher space complexity value, as compared to changing values in an array.

No direct correlation between space and time complexity.
