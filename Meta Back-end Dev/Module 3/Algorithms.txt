Divide and Conquer:
- Dividing one value into many and then merging back into one. 
- Parellelisation: Computers working on the same problem at the same time, speeding up computation. 
- Memory management: Large problems can be processed in chunks, making it easier to handle data that doesn't fit in memory.



Recursion:
- Recursion is an alternative to loops. Recursion is like loop. 
- Base case: the condition that stops the Recursion (loop)
- Diminishing structure: each call works on a smaller or simpler problem. 
- Recursive call: The function calls itself with the new input. 
- Break complex problems into simpler, repeatable steps.
