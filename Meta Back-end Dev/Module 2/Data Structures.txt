Data structure models an object so that it can be stored into computer memory.
Data structure can be passed to a function, returned as a result and generally treated like any other variable.

Linear data structure: array, queue, stack, linked list
Non-linear data structure: tree, graph

Strings:
Mutability: ability to change a string after it has been created.
Immutability: cannot change the string after it is created (python, javascript, java)

Purpose of parsing a string is to remove items from a string not based on a given format. 

You will alwyays use a for loop for arrays. 

Matrix is a 2-dimensional array



Objects: Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Code is encapsulated into objects, and these objects then interact with one another

Inheritance for objects:
- create a class that holds all the common attributes, and each object can inherit them.
- Polymorphism (one shape, many forms)
